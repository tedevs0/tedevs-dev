I’ve been using **WakaTime** for years almost without thinking about it. I installed it, let it run in the background, and kept coding.

This year I discovered something called **WakaTime Wrapped**, and when I looked at my 2025 stats, I realized those numbers tell a much more interesting story than it seems at first glance.

This is mine.

## 2025 Summary

These were my main numbers for the year:

- **1,241 hours and 32 minutes coding**
- **Daily average:** 4 hours and 30 minutes
- **Top 2%** among more than 600,000 developers
- **Most active day:** August 28, 2025 (18 h 29 min)
- **Main editor:** VS Code
- **Operating system:** Windows
- **Primary language:** Vue.js

This isn’t about a single record-breaking moment. It’s the result of many normal days adding up.

## Work rhythm

Looking at the yearly activity calendar, one thing became clear: my year wasn’t an endless sprint or a series of extreme peaks. There was consistency, yes, but not all of it was healthy.

**Tuesdays** were my strongest day, and there’s activity spread throughout the entire year, including weekends. But being honest, many of those weekends weren’t about exemplary discipline — they happened because I couldn’t finish tasks on time during the week.

That’s a clear sign of something I need to improve.

Working weekends on a regular basis isn’t sustainability, it’s wear and tear. Resting, sleeping well, and respecting breaks are also part of being a better developer in the long run.

Consistency matters, but **without rest, it’s not progress — it’s debt**.

---

## Key languages

My coding time was mainly distributed like this:

- **Vue.js** — 398 h 31 min
- **Astro** — 238 h 45 min
- **PHP** — 183 h 28 min
- **TypeScript** — 158 h 21 min
- **JavaScript** — 124 h 20 min

This stack reflects my focus throughout 2025: modern frontend, personal products, content, tooling, and real systems in production.

---

## Tools

No big surprises here:

- **VS Code:** 1,241 h 32 min
- **Windows:** 1,231 h 43 min
- **WSL:** occasional use

When a tool stops being the protagonist and simply supports your work, you know it has become part of your natural workflow.

---

## Context and comparison

WakaTime also compares my numbers against the global average:

- My daily average: **4 h 30 min**
- Global average: **51 min**
- My most active day: **18 h 29 min**

I don’t see this as competition, but as context. Comparing only makes sense if it helps you understand where you stand and what you want to improve.

---

## Learnings

This summary doesn’t tell me whether I’m “productive” or not. It leaves me with more useful takeaways:

- Consistency weighs more than energy spikes
- Personal projects take more time than we usually realize
- Measuring time should help you decide better, not punish yourself

A lot of real progress happens on ordinary days, not legendary ones.

---

## Adjustments for 2026

Seeing these stats also forces me to be critical with myself.

Coding on weekends on a regular basis is not something I want to normalize. In many cases, it was the result of poor time management during the week, not a conscious or healthy choice.

For 2026, I want to:

- Protect weekends as real rest time
- Sleep better and respect more sustainable schedules
- Organize tasks better to avoid unnecessary spillover
- Measure time not just to produce more, but to live better

Being consistent shouldn’t mean being available all the time. Real improvement is about **maintaining the rhythm without burning out**.

## Closing

WakaTime Wrapped isn’t just a nice-looking chart. It’s an honest snapshot of how you used your time over an entire year — the good parts and the things that need correction.

Tracking hours is useless if it doesn’t lead to better decisions. In my case, this summary makes it clear that productivity without rest eventually takes its toll.

If you code regularly and have never reviewed your yearly stats, it’s worth doing at least once. Not to compare yourself with others, but to understand your own habits.

Now it’s time to use these numbers not to work more, but to **work better in 2026**.

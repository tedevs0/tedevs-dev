Productivity is a skill that everyone can improve with small changes in habits and routines. It's not about working more hours, but about working smarter to achieve better results.

## 1. Prioritize Your Tasks

One of the keys to being productive is knowing what is most important. Use techniques like the Eisenhower Matrix or the 80/20 rule to identify which tasks have the greatest impact and focus on them first.

## 2. Eliminate Distractions

Constant interruptions reduce your concentration and performance. Turn off notifications, close unnecessary tabs, and create a workspace free from distractions.

## 3. Set Clear Goals

Define specific and measurable objectives for each day. This will help you stay focused and have a clear sense of progress throughout the day.

## 4. Take Regular Breaks

Although it may seem counterintuitive, taking breaks improves your productivity. Use techniques like Pomodoro to work in blocks and take short breaks that recharge your mental energy.
